  <h2>Mobile Phone Data Collection</h2>
  <p>Your mobile phone will be used for this study. You will download the mobile
     application where you will complete the questionnaires and mobile games and
     tests. The application will also collect data on your phone usage and
     activity. We will send notices on your phone asking you to complete these
     tasks and surveys at specific times via push notifications through the
     mobile application. You can use the notification settings on your phone
     to control your notifications. We will inform you of these options during
     the study consent and review process.<p>

  <p><em>Daily online questionnaires:</em> You will be asked to complete some
    questions on your mobile phone at the in-person assessment and you will also
    be asked to complete two mobile questionnaires each day for at least the
    next 3 weeks. The questions will be about your mood, thoughts and behaviors
    over the recent past. In addition you will be prompted to complete at least
    one game like mobile task each time you complete the questionnaires. This
    will last 3 weeks.</p>

  <p><em>Text Message Data:</em> You will also be asked a few questions via text
    message about your experiences in the study. This data is separate from the
    mobile phone application data collection.</p>

  <p><em>Daily mobile phone data:</em> The app will track your use of the app
    and features in the app. This way the researchers can find out more about
    how often the app is typically used by participants, which specific features
    of the app are used, etc. In addition, we will collect other information
    about your mobile phone use such as when your phone is in use, when it is
    not, when you are using applications, the number of text messages sent and
    received, and your activity and movement. It is important to note that we
    do not collect the content of your interactions with others, but rather when
    and how many things are happening on your phone. <em>We will NOT access your
    personal contacts, text message content, personal photos, or websites
    visited, only the frequency and timing of your interaction with your phone.</em> 
    During the training, we will show you these data collection features
    visually. This functionality is critical to the study, and these tracking
    devices are strictly necessary in order for you to use the app and to
    participate in the study. However, you may change your preference from time
    to time during the study, should you wish to do so by calling the
    researcher.</p>
