<p>Sometimes, once the study is over, we realize we may have additional
  questions about your experience of change and being in the study. We are
  asking your permission to re-contact you after the study to ask you questions
  about your experience of change and being in the study. You may withdraw
  permission at any time, as it will not affect your participation in the
  study.</p>
