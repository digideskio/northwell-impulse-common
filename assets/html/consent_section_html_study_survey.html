<body>

  <p>You have already provided preliminary consent to be pre-screened using the
    web-form or in a telephone interview. We are requesting written informed
    consent for your participation in this study, including confirming your
    eligibility. If you agree to participate in this study, you will undergo an
    assessment in order to confirm your eligibility for this study and determine
    if this study is appropriate for you. For example, this study is looking at
    peopleâ€™s fluctuations in mood or risk taking and you need to be willing to
    complete all the daily questionnaires. The assessment that you will receive
    after signing this consent will determine if you are eligible.</p>

  <p>You may withdraw from the study at any time. If you choose to participate
    in this study and at any time you feel that what is offered in this study
    is not addressing your needs sufficiently, you will be provided with
    referrals to community organizations or private practitioners.</p>

  <p>At your only in-person appointment will undergo a first study visit where
    you will complete questionnaires about yourself, feelings and behavior, and
    computer and mobile game like tests lasting about 2 hours. After this
    appointment you will download a mobile application,  complete a 5 minute
    morning survey and game, and complete a 5 minute evening survey and game
    for the next 3 weeks (14 morning surveys of 5 minutes each and 14 evening
    surveys of 5 minutes each). You will also be asked to complete a 10 minute
    2 week survey on the internet. You only have to come  to the clinic one
    time. Below is a list of the procedures for this study:<p>

  <ul>
      <li>Complete internet screening form</li>
      <li>Review consent form</li>
      <li>Schedule your one in-person appointment</li>
      <li>Come to the office for a 2 hour assessment</li>
      <li>Watch a video on completing your mobile assessments</li>
      <li>Download the mobile assessment and feedback application</li>
      <li>Complete the mobile app sign-up process</li>
      <li>Complete daily 5 minute morning surveys for 3 weeks</li>
      <li>Complete daily 5 minute evening surveys for 3 weeks</li>
      <li>Complete a 10 minute survey after 3 weeks</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Mobile Phone Data Collection</h2>
  <p>Your mobile phone will be used for this study. You will download the mobile
     application where you will complete the questionnaires and mobile games and
     tests. The application will also collect data on your phone usage and
     activity. We will send notices on your phone asking you to complete these
     tasks and surveys at specific times via push notifications through the
     mobile application. You can use the notification settings on your phone
     to control your notifications. We will inform you of these options during
     the study consent and review process.<p>

  <p><em>Daily online questionnaires:</em> You will be asked to complete some
    questions on your mobile phone at the in-person assessment and you will also
    be asked to complete two mobile questionnaires each day for at least the
    next 3 weeks. The questions will be about your mood, thoughts and behaviors
    over the recent past. In addition you will be prompted to complete at least
    one game like mobile task each time you complete the questionnaires. This
    will last 3 weeks.</p>

  <p><em>Text Message Data:</em> You will also be asked a few questions via text
    message about your experiences in the study. This data is separate from the
    mobile phone application data collection.</p>

  <p><em>Daily mobile phone data:</em> The app will track your use of the app
    and features in the app. This way the researchers can find out more about
    how often the app is typically used by participants, which specific features
    of the app are used, etc. In addition, we will collect other information
    about your mobile phone use such as when your phone is in use, when it is
    not, when you are using applications, the number of text messages sent and
    received, and your activity and movement. It is important to note that we
    do not collect the content of your interactions with others, but rather when
    and how many things are happening on your phone. <em>We will NOT access your
    personal contacts, text message content, personal photos, or websites
    visited, only the frequency and timing of your interaction with your phone.</em>
    During the training, we will show you these data collection features
    visually. This functionality is critical to the study, and these tracking
    devices are strictly necessary in order for you to use the app and to
    participate in the study. However, you may change your preference from time
    to time during the study, should you wish to do so by calling the
    researcher.</p>

  <p><em>Three week 10 minute survey:</em> At the end of the three week period
    we will ask you to complete one final mobile questionnaire, which includes
    questions about your experiences during the study period along with the full
    version of the game like tasks. This will take about 10 minutes.</p>

  <p><em>Chart Review:</em> If you were recruited from the GAP study
    (PI: Gregerson), we ask you to give consent to review your data from that
    study to help us understand how genetics may influence self-regulation.</p>
