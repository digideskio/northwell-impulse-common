  <p>You have already provided preliminary consent to be pre-screened using the
    web-form or in a telephone interview. We are requesting written informed
    consent for your participation in this study, including confirming your
    eligibility. If you agree to participate in this study, you will undergo an
    assessment in order to confirm your eligibility for this study and determine
    if this study is appropriate for you. For example, this study is looking at
    peopleâ€™s fluctuations in mood or risk taking and you need to be willing to
    complete all the daily questionnaires. The assessment that you will receive
    after signing this consent will determine if you are eligible.</p>

  <p>You may withdraw from the study at any time. If you choose to participate
    in this study and at any time you feel that what is offered in this study
    is not addressing your needs sufficiently, you will be provided with
    referrals to community organizations or private practitioners.</p>

  <p>At your only in-person appointment will undergo a first study visit where
    you will complete questionnaires about yourself, feelings and behavior, and
    computer and mobile game like tests lasting about 2 hours. After this
    appointment you will download a mobile application,  complete a 5 minute
    morning survey and game, and complete a 5 minute evening survey and game
    for the next 3 weeks (14 morning surveys of 5 minutes each and 14 evening
    surveys of 5 minutes each). You will also be asked to complete a 10 minute
    2 week survey on the internet. You only have to come  to the clinic one
