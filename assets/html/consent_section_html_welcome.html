        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>You are being asked to join a research study called, “Understanding
        Daily Fluctuations in Self-Regulation.” The purpose of a research study
        is to answer specific questions about your experiences and how they vary
        over time to help improve our understanding of health and wellbeing.</p>

        <p>This consent form will explain:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>the purpose of the study</li>
            <li>what you will be asked to do</li>
            <li>the potential risks and benefits</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why is this research study being done?</h2>

        <p>The purpose of this study is to understand whether using a mobile
          health application that you download onto your mobile will help you
          and us understand how your levels of concentration, self-regulation
          and control vary throughout the day and in different circumstances,
          like when you are feeling happy or sad or in the morning or evening.
          Although mobile phone apps have been made to help people monitor their
          behavior, we still do not know whether they work to improve your
          health. In this study, we ask you to come into our offices to fill
          out questionnaires and then use the mobile application in your daily
          life. </p>

        <p>In the first part of our research, you will come into our offices for
          a 2 hour research appointment and complete questionnaires along with
          computer and mobile game like tests. Once you complete these tests,
          you will download a mobile app and use it twice a day for about 10
          minutes per day (5 minutes in the morning and 5 minutes in the
          evening). You can base your app usage around your schedule. We want to
          see if we can execute this study solely by phone and to study how well
          the mobile app features work. We will use information about how you
          use the app to make the app better, but also provide you feedback on
          how your scores on the mobile tasks differ depending on certain
          factors, like time of day and mood. </p>

        <h2>Why is this research?</h2>

        <p>This is a research study because we are asking you to provide
          information on your mood, thoughts and impulses both in a clinic
          setting and while you are in your natural environment. </p>


        <h2>How many people will take part in this study?</h2>

        <p>This research study hopes to enroll 100-150 men and women.</p>

        <h2>How long will you be in this study?</h2>

        <p>If you choose to take part in this study, the study period will last
          for a total of 3 weeks from the time you enroll in the study, but you
          will be able to use the mobile application for longer if you wish.<p>
