//general comments
//RStack deserializes into intermediate object TaskModel
//which then is converted into a SmartSurvey
//the DataProvider interface takes a TaskScheduleModel
/*{
  "taskTitle"
  "taskID"
  "taskFileName"
  "taskClassName"
  "taskCompletionTimeString"
}*/
//and returns a Task object

//lets think of the task descriptor as some metadata (identifier, etc)
//as well as some entities that map onto an array of steps (hopefully with navigation support, future)
//each of these entities should be treated as itself an array of entities
//the parser must be able to handle both built-in and custom types
